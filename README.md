# Nagios Host Finder (CLI)

This is a script I created after numerous "Are we currently monitoring this host?" emails/messages. Instead of logging into the various nagios environments, manually, I just run this script with a file containing the hosts/s to search for, as an argument. On completion the script generates two files. In_Nagios.txt and Not_In_Nagios.txt.
